# Python Calculator  
A simple command-line calculator built using Python functions, loops, and user input.

## 📌 Description  
This project demonstrates how to build a basic calculator using Python functions (`def`), loops, and conditional statements.  
It allows the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division repeatedly until they choose to exit.

## ⚙ Features  
- Add two numbers  
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers  
- Divide two numbers  
- Prevent division by zero  
- Loop-based menu that runs until user exits  

## 🧠 Concepts Used  
- Functions (`def`)  
- Return statements  
- While loops  
- User input handling  
- If/elif/else conditions  
- Error handling (division by zero)  

## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Install Python (if not already installed)  
2. Save the code as `calculator.py`  
3. Open terminal in the same folder  
4. Run the command:
## 📝 Example Input / Output  
**Input:**
## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Add power, modulus, square root  
- Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt  
- Add history of operations
